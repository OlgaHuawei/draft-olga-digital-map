1.  Introduction

   The [RFC8345] is a topology-based YANG model with many augmentations
   for different technologies and service types.  The modelling approach
   based on [RFC8345] provides the out of box standard IETF based API.

Internet-Draft            Digital Map Modelling                June 2023


   At the time of writing those lines, there are 60 YANG Modules
   augmenting [RFC8345], 59 IETF and 1 BBF. 8 have maturity level
   'ratified', 15 have maturity level 'adopted', 21 have maturity level
   'latest-approved' and 16 have maturity level 'initial'.  The up to
   date information can be found in the YANG Catalogue at
   https://yangcatalog.org/yang-search/impact_analysis/ietf-network-
   topology@2018-02-26.

   From this long series of IETF RFCs and IETF drafts, we attempted to
   create a Digital Map PoC, with the following objectives and
   functionality:

   *  Understanding how the different topology-related IETF YANG modules
      fit together, starting from the central RFC 8345.  We developed
      our proof of concept (PoC) with a real lab, based on multi-vendor
      devices.

   *  Modelling of digital map entities, relationships, and rules how to
      build aggregated entities and relationships.

   *  Modelling multiple underlay/overlay layers from L2 to customer
      service layer

   *  Practically, the PoC based our modelling on [RFC8345] and we
      successfully modelled the following technologies:

   - L2 Network Topology (used [RFC8944])

   - L3 Network Topology (used [RFC8346])

   - OSPF Routing (to be further aligned with
   [I-D.ogondio-opsawg-ospf-topology])

   - IS-IS Routing (to be further aligned with
   [I-D.ogondio-lsr-isis-topology])

   - BGP Routing

   - MPLS LDP

   - MPLS TE Tunnels

   - SRv6 Tunnels

   - L3 VPN Services

Internet-Draft            Digital Map Modelling                June 2023


   This draft documents our experience in the modeling aspects of the
   digital map, based on our PoC implementation, basically documenting
   our work and the open issues encountered.

   During the PoC, we also defined the requirements and verified the PoC
   approach by demoing it iteratively.
   // Discuss: should we have requirements in the separate document.  If
   // so, add 'The requirements are defined in a separate draft [I-D
   // ref]'

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Digital Twin -  as defined in
      [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch], it is: virtual instance
      of a physical system (twin) that is continually updated with the
      latter's performance, maintenance and health status data
      throughout the physical system's life cycle.

   Digital Map -
      // There is no digital map definition in the NMRG Digital Twin
      basis for the Digital Twin that provides a virtual instance of the
      topological information of the network.  It provides the core
      multi-layer topology model and data for the digital twin and
      connects them to the other digital twin models and data.

   Digital Map Modelling -  modelling the Digital Map using the IETF
      [RFC8345] approach, by defining the supported network types
      (layers and sublayers), entity types, entity roles (network, node,
      tp or link), entity properties and relationships types between
      entities.

   Digital Map Model -  defines the core topological entities, their
      role in the network, core properties and relationships both inside
      each layer and between the layers.  It is the basic topological
      model that is linked to other functional parts of the digital twin
      and connects them all: configuration, maintenance, assurance
      (KPIs, status, health, symptoms), traffic engineering, different
      behaviours, simulation, emulation, mathematical abstractions, AI
      algorithms, etc

   Digital Map Data -  consists of virtual instances of network and

      service topologies at different layers.  The data can be
      historical, real-time or future data for what-if scenarios.

   Topology -  is defined in Oxford Dictionary as the way in which
      constituents parts of something are interrelated or arranged.
      Network topology defines how physical or logical nodes, links and
      interfaces are related and arranges.  Service topology defines how
      service components (e.g VRX, customer interfaces, customer links)
      between customer sites are interrelated and arranged.

2.  Digital Map Intro and how it relates to Digital Twin

2.1.  What is Digital Twin?

   The digital twin concepts and the reference architecture of the
   network digital twin are proposed in the NMRG draft
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch].  This NMRG draft defines
   the Digital Twin as 'a virtual instance of a physical system (twin)
   that is continually updated with the latter's performance,
   maintenance and health status data throughout the physical system's
   life cycle'.

   The draft [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] states that a
   digital twin network can be regarded as an indispensable part of the
   overall network system and provides a general architecture involving
   the whole life cycle of physical networks in the future, serving the
   application of innovative network technologies such as network
   planning, construction, maintenance and optimization, improving the
   automation and intelligence level of the network.
   // TODO: Review with Benoit terminology and here, do we duplicate or
   // add all in terminology?  Also, capitalized versus not capitalized.
   // In other drafts capitalized is used for terminology and
   // definitions, but we may decide to have it unified.

   The draft [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] defines the core
   elements of digital twin - Data, Models, Interfaces and Mapping.  The
   digital twin network constructed based on the four core technology
   elements can analyze, diagnose, emulate, and control the physical
   network in its whole life cycle with the help of optimization
   algorithms, management methods, and expert knowledge

2.2.  Digital Map Definition

   Digital Map provides the core multi-layer topology model and data for
   the digital twin and connects them to the other digital twin models
   and data.

Internet-Draft            Digital Map Modelling                June 2023


   The Digital Map Modelling defines the core topological entities,
   their role in the network, core properties and relationships both
   inside each layer and between the layers.

   The Digital Map Model is a basic topological model that is linked to
   other functional parts of the digital twin and connects them all:
   configuration, maintenance, assurance (KPIs, status, health,
   symptoms), traffic engineering, different behaviours and actions,
   simulation, emulation, mathematical abstractions, AI algorithms, etc.

   The Digital Map Data consists of virtual instances of network and
   service topologies at different layers.  The Digital Map provides the
   access to this data via standard API for both read and write, with
   query capabilities and links to other YANG modules (SAIN
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-service-assurance-architecture], SAP
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-sap], Inventory
   [I-D.wzwb-opsawg-network-inventory-management], Assets
   [I-D.palmero-opsawg-dmlmo], ...) and non-YANG mode.

2.3.  Why Digital Map?

   One of the important requirements for the Digitalization and Digital
   Twin is to correlate all models and data to topological entities at
   different layers in the layered twin network.  This draft evaluates
   how well the RFC8345-based YANG models are suited for the Digital Map
   Modelling.  The Digital Map would provide a virtual instance of the
   topological information of the network, based on this Digital Map
   Model.  The Digital Map is the first step towards the Digital Twin.
   The Digital Map Model and Data will provide this missing correlation
   between the topology models and data and all other models and data:
   KPIs, alarms, incidents, inventory (with UUIDs), configuration,
   traffic engineering, planning (what if), simulation, emulations,
   actions, behaviours.  Some of these models and data are in the
   context of device, some in context of network or subnetwork and some
   in context of customer services, needed for both inner and outer
   closed-loops.  Therefore, Digital Map is needed to break down data
   islands and have a digital twin for simulation and closed loop, which
   is required to solve autonomous networking.  The following are some
   use cases that require Digital Map:

   *  Generic Inventory Queries

   *  o Service-> subservice -> resource

   *  o Resource -> subservice -> service

   *  Intent/Service Assurance

Internet-Draft            Digital Map Modelling                June 2023


   *  Service E2E and Per-Link KPIs on the digital map (delay, jitter,
      loss)

   *  Capacity Planning

   *  Simulation

   *  Closed Loop

2.4.  Other Related IETF Activities

   The following standards are core for the Digital Map.

   *  IETF Network Model and Network Topology Model [RFC8345]

   *  A YANG Grouping for Geographic Location [RFC9179]

   *  IETF Modules that augment [RFC8345] for differenet technologies:

   *  o A YANG Data Model for Traffic Engineering (TE) Topologies
      [RFC8795]

   *  o A YANG Data Model for Layer 2 Network Topologies [RFC8944]

   *  o A YANG Data Model for OSFP Topology
      [I-D.ogondio-opsawg-ospf-topology]

   *  o A YANG Data Model for IS-IS Topology
      [I-D.ogondio-lsr-isis-topology]

   The Digital Map may need to link to the following models, some are
   already augmenting [RFC8345], we need further investigation for each
   of these items:

   *  Service Access Point (SAP) [I-D.ietf-opsawg-sap], augments 'ietf-
      network' data model [RFC8345] by adding the SAP inventory

   *  SAIN [I-D.ietf-opsawg-service-assurance-architecture] and
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-service-assurance-yang]

   *  An Inventory Management Model for Enterprise Networks
      [I-D.wzwb-opsawg-network-inventory-management] augments 'ietf-
      network-topology' with inventory information for node, link and
      termination-point.  It also has UUIDs.

   *  Data Model for Lifecycle Management and Operations
      [I-D.palmero-opsawg-dmlmo]

Internet-Draft            Digital Map Modelling                June 2023


   *  KPIs: delay, jitter, loss

   *  Attachement Circuits (ACs)
      [I-D.boro-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit] and
      [I-D.boro-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit]

   *  Configuration: L2SM [RFC8466], L3SM [RFC8049], L2NM [RFC9291],
      L3NM [RFC9182]

   *  Incident Management for Network Services
      [I-D.feng-opsawg-incident-management]

   *  Transaction ID
      // Benoit thinks we should remove it, lets discuss, I thought it
      // would be good to have the link to the last transaction IDs
      related
      // to different services.

   *  Etc?

3.  Digital Map Requirements

   The following are the core requirements for the Digital Map:
   // Further discussion: should we remove it from this draft and have a
   // separate draft

   1.   Basic model with Network, Node, Link, Interface

   2.   Layered Digital Map, from physical network up to customer
        service and intent

   3.   Open and Programmable Digital Map. This includes read / Write
        for Digital Map (write important for future simulations and what
        if scenarios).  Doing what-if analysis requires the ability to
        take snapshots and to switch easily between them.  Because we
        have to distinguish between a change on the digital map for
        future simulation and a change that reflects the current reality
        of the network.

   4.   Standard based Digital Map Models and APIs (e.g. based on IETF
        Network Topology).  Digital Map must provide the standards APIs
        that provide for Read / Write and queries.  This API must also
        provide the capability to retrieve the links to external data /
        models.

   5.   Digital Map Models and APIs must be common over different
        network domains




Havel, et al.           Expires 15 December 2023                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            Digital Map Modelling                June 2023


   6.   Digital Map must be multi-vendor

   7.   Digital Map must provide semantics for layered network
        topologies and for linking external models/data

   8.   Digital Map must provide inter-layer and between layer
        relationships

   9.   Digital Map must be extensible with meta data

   10.  Digital Map must be pluggable a) We must connect to other YANG
        modules for Configuration, Inventory, Intent Assurance (SAIN),
        etc b) Not everything can be in YANG, we need to connect Digital
        Map YANG model with other modelling mechanisms, both southbound,
        northbound and internally

   11.  Digital Map must be optimized for graph traversal for paths.
        This means that only providing link nodes and source and sink
        relationships to termination-points may not be sufficient, we
        may need to have the direct relationship between the termination
        points or nodes

   The requirements [1-6] are automatically fulfilled with RFC8345 and
   extensions.  The requirements [7-8] are partially fulfiled, there may
   be need for some additional semantics.  The requirements [9-11] will
   need some extensions to the RFC8345.  In some cases for [10], the
   links are already sone by augmenting 'ietf-network' and 'ietf-
   network-topology'.  For others, we need to add some mechanims to link
   the models and data.
   // If we remove requirements, we can focus on this section.  Benoit's
   // comment Maybe we can focus this section on "why RFC 8345 is a good
   // approach for D.M." => because we have the point 1 to 6

   The following are the scope requirements for the Digital Map:

   1.  Digital Map should contain only topological information

   2.  Digital Map entities should contain only properties used to
       identify topological entities at different layers, identify their
       roles and topological relationships between them

   3.  Digital Map should contain only topological relationships inside
       each layer or between the layers (underlay/overlay)

   4.  Digital Map should only have links to other functional Digital
       Twin data and models.

   5.  ACLs and Route Policies will be outside of the digital map, they
       would be linked to digital map

   6.  Dynamic paths may either be outside of the digital map, part of
       traffic engineering data/models

   7.  Provide capability for conditional retrieval of parts of digital
       map

   8.  Must support geo-spatial, temporal, and historical data

   The following are the arch requirements for the Digital Map:

   1.  Scale, performance, integration

   2.  Initial discovery and dynamic (change only) synch

4.  Digital Map Modelling Experience

4.1.  IETF Network Topology Approach

4.1.1.  IETF Network Topology

4.1.1.1.  IETF Network Topology TE

4.1.1.1.1.  How to augment for generic Digital Map extensions

   Generic Digital Map extensions are the RFC8345 extensions required
   for all technologies and layers in the Digital Map. We have the
   following options: - make backward compatible updates to RFC8345 -
   augment RFC8345 network, node, link and termination point for any
   changes needed module: dm-network-topology augment /nw:networks/
   nw:network: ....  augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node: ....
   augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link: ....  augment
   /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/nt:termination-point: ....
   // This can be a separate draft

4.1.1.1.2.  How to augment for new technologies / layers

   There are already drafts that support augmentation for specific
   technologies.  These drafts augment network, node, termination point
   and link, but also add different topological entities inside
   augmentations.  For example, we have examples like this: module: new-
   module augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:network-types: +--rw new-
   topology!  augment /nw:networks/nw:network: ....  augment
   /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node: .... adding list of tps of other
   type (e.g. tunnel TPs in te draft) ... adding new supporting
   relationship supporting-tunnel-termination-point (te draft) augment

   /nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link: .... adding tunnels (te draft)
   augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/nt:termination-point: ....
   There is need to agree some guidelines for augmenting IETF network
   topology, so that additional topological information is not added in
   the custom way.  This may either involve - adding concepts from TE
   and SAP topological augmentations to the core digital map topology in
   the similar way they were added in the corresponding drafts or -
   using the TP to model SAP and 'link' to model tunnel in the core
   Digital Map
   // This can be a separate draft.  Guidelines with examples?

4.1.2.  What is not in the basic model

   The following are the [RFC8345] extensions needed for Digital Map
   modelling and APIs:

   *  Bidirectional links

   *  Multi-point connectivity (hub and spoke, full mesh, complex)

   *  We may need additional supporting relationships: supporting for
      TP->Node, supporting for Node->Network

   *  More Network-related semantic is needed, for example:

   *  We modelled Tunnels ad Paths via [RFC8345] but we lost some
      semantics that is in RFC8795

   *  We modelled all relationships via supporting, maybe extend with
      how underlay is done in RFC8795

   *  Relationship Properties

   *  Subtypes

   *  Layers/ sub-layers

   *  Some common roles: primary, backup, aggregation, hub, spoke

4.1.3.  Open issues for further analysis

   The following are the open issues that need further analysis:

   *  Do we need separation of L2 and L3 topologies?

   *  Do we need sublayers as well?  Layers versus sublayers?  E.g.
      Routing versus OSPF, IS-IS

   *  Same technology at service versus underlay?  BGP per VPN vs common
      BGP shared between multiple VPNs.  Different layers, same model,
      relationship define the layer.

4.1.4.  How to connect to the external world

   How to connect to other YANG modules

   How to connect YANG models with other modelling mechanisms

4.1.5.  Digital Map APIs

   This will include hierarchical APIs for cross-domain figure, IETF
   YANG Based API (read and write, change subscription and notify) and
   Query API

4.1.6.  Digital Map Knowledge

   The following knowledge was needed to build digital map:

   *  Abstract IETF Entities and Relationships as in [RFC8345]

   *  [RFC8345] Augmentations for a)Layers/sublayers b)Entities
      (services and subservices), c)Properties

   *  Rules for aggregating entities

   *  Rules for instantiating relationships Relationships (inter-layer
      and intra-layer)

   *  Mapping from devices and controllers

   What can be achieved with existing RFC8345 YANG:

   *  Entities (base class IETF Network, IETF Node, IETF Link, IETF TP)

   *  Properties

   *  Relationships

   Next steps

   *  How to add temporal

   *  How to add spacial

   *  How to add historical

5.  Conclusions

   Digital Map Modelling and Data are basis for the Digital Twin.
   During our PoC we have proven that Digital Map can be modelled using
   [RFC8345].  Nevertheless, we proposed some extensions/augmentations
   to [RFC8345] to support Digital Maps.  There must be some constraints
   in regards to how to augment the core Digital Map model for different
   Layers and Technologies in order to support the approach in our PoC.
   All entities must augment IETF node, IETF network, IETF link or IETF
   Termination Point and augmentation can only include new properties.
