      <t>
		The <xref target="RFC8345"/> is a topology-based YANG model with many YANG augmentations for
		different technologies and service types. The modelling approach 
		based on <xref target="RFC8345"/> provides the out of box standard IETF based API.
	  </t>
	  <t>
		At the time of writing those lines, there are 60 YANG Modules augmenting <xref target="RFC8345"/>,
		59 IETF and 1 BBF. 8 have maturity level 'ratified', 15 have maturity level 'adopted', 
		21 have maturity level 'latest-approved' and 16 have maturity level 'initial'.
		The up-to-date information can be found in the YANG Catalog at 
		<eref target="https://yangcatalog.org/yang-search/impact_analysis/ietf-network-topology@2018-02-26"/>.
	  </t>
	  <t>
		From this long series of IETF RFCs and IETF drafts, we attempted 
		to create a Digital Map PoC, with the following objectives and 
		functionalities:
	  </t>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Can the central RFC 8345 YANG Module be a good basis to model a Digital Map? 
			</li>
			<li>
				Understanding how the different topology-related IETF YANG modules fit together/
			</li>
			<li>
				Modelling of digital map entities, relationships, and rules how to 
		    build aggregated entities and relationships. Does the base model support all the 
		    requirements?
			</li>
			<li>
			  Modelling multiple underlay/overlay layers from layer 2 to layer 3 to customer 
		    service layer. Can the base model be augmented for any new technologies?
			</li>
			<li>
        Can the base model be augmented for any new layer and technologies?
			</li>
			<li>
			  Practically, we developed our proof of concept (PoC) with a real lab, based 
			  on multi-vendor devices, with <xref target="RFC8345"/> as the base YANG module. 
			  The PoC successfully modelled the following technologies:
			</li>
		</ul>
			<t>
			- Layer 2 Network Topology (used <xref target="RFC8944"/>)
			</t>
			<t>
			- Layer 3 Network Topology (used <xref target="RFC8346"/>)
			</t>
			<t>
			- OSPF Routing (to be further aligned with <xref target="I-D.ogondio-opsawg-ospf-topology"/>)
			</t>
			<t>
			- IS-IS Routing (to be further aligned with <xref target="I-D.ogondio-lsr-isis-topology"/>)
			</t>
			<t>
			- BGP Routing
			</t>
			<t>
			- MPLS LDP
			</t>
			<t>
			- MPLS TE Tunnels
			</t>
			<t>
			- SRv6 Tunnels
			</t>
			<t>
			- L3 VPN Services
			</t>
	  <t>
		  This draft documents our experience in the modeling aspects of the digital map, based on our PoC
		  implementation, basically documenting our work and the open issues encountered.
	  </t>
	  <t>
		During the PoC, we also defined the requirements and verified the 
		PoC approach by demoing it iteratively.
		  <cref>

		    This draft defines the core elements of digital twin - Data, Models,

			  The Digital Map Model is a basic topological model that is linked

	  		One of the important requirements for the Digitalization 
		  	and Digital Twin is to correlate all models and data to 
			  topological entities at different layers in the layered twin network. 
  			The Digital Map would provide a virtual instance of the topological 
	  		information of the network, based on this Digital Map Model. The 
		  	Digital Map is the first step towards the Digital Twin. 
			
        The Digital Map Model and Data will provide this missing correlation 
  			between the topology models and data and all other models and data: 
	  		KPIs, alarms, incidents, inventory (with UUIDs), 
		  	configuration, traffic engineering, planning (what if), 
			  simulation, emulations, actions, behaviours.
			  
  			Some of these models and data are in the context of device, 
	  		some in context of network or subnetwork and some in context of 
		  	customer services, needed for both inner and outer closed-loops.
			
  			Therefore, Digital Map is needed to break down data islands and 
	  		have a digital twin for simulation and closed loop, which is 
		  	required to solve autonomous networking.

  			The following are some use cases that require Digital Map:

	 <section anchor="ditial-map-requirements" title="Digital Map Requirements">
	 <t>
		The following are the core requirements for the Digital Map:
		<cref>
		   Further discussion: should we remove it from this draft and have a separate draft
		</cref>

	 </t>
	 <ol>
		<li>
			Basic model with Network, Node, Link, Interface entity types
		</li>
		<li>
			Layered Digital Map, from physical network (layer 2, layer 3) up to customer service and intent
		</li>
		<li>			
			Open and Programmable Digital Map. This includes "Read" to understand the view of the network. 
			It also "Write", not for the ability to directly change the Digital Map Data (ex: changing the 
			network or service parameters), but for offline simulations, also known as what-if scenarios. 
			Doing what-if analysis requires the ability to take snapshots and to switch easily between them.  
      Because we have to distinguish between a change on the digital map for future simulation 
      and a change that reflects the current reality of the network.
		</li>
		<li>			
			Standard based Digital Map Models and APIs, for multi-vendor support. Digital Map must provide 
			the standard APIs that provide for Read / Write and queries. This API must also provide the capability 
			to retrieve the links to external data / models.  
		</li>
		<li>
			Digital Map Models and APIs must be common over different network domains
		</li>
		<li>
			Digital Map must provide semantics for layered network topologies and for linking external models/data
		</li>
		<li>
			Digital Map must provide inter-layer and between layer relationships
		</li>
		<li>
			Digital Map must be extensible with meta data
		</li>
		<li>
			Digital Map must be pluggable
			a)	 We must connect to other YANG modules for Configuration, 
			    Inventory, Intent Assurance (SAIN), etc
			b)	Not everything can be in YANG, we need to connect Digital Map 
			    YANG model with other modelling mechanisms, both southbound, 
				northbound and internally
		</li>
		<li>
			Digital Map must be optimized for graph traversal for paths. This means
			that only providing link nodes and source and sink relationships to 
			termination-points may not be sufficient, we may need to have the direct relationship
			between the termination points or nodes
		</li>
	  </ol>
	 <t>
		The requirements [1-6] are automatically fulfilled with RFC8345 and extensions.
		The requirements [7-8] are partially fulfiled, there may be need for some additional semantics.
		The requirements [9-11] will need some extensions to the RFC8345. 
	  In some cases for [10], the links are already sone by augmenting 'ietf-network' and 
		'ietf-network-topology'. For others, we need to add some mechanims to link the models and data.
		 <cref>
		    If we remove requirements, we can focus on this section. Benoit's comment
		    Maybe we can focus this section on "why RFC 8345 is a good approach for D.M." 
            =>	because we have the point 1 to 6
		 </cref>
	 </t>
	 <t>
		The following are the scope requirements for the Digital Map:
	 </t>
	 <ol>
		<li>			
			Digital Map should contain only topological information 
		</li>
		<li>
			Digital Map entities should contain only properties used to identify topological entities at different layers, 
			    identify their roles and topological relationships between them
		</li>
		<li>
			Digital Map should contain only topological relationships inside each layer or between the layers (underlay/overlay)
		</li>
		<li>
			Digital Map should only have links to other functional Digital Twin data and models.
		</li>
		<li>
			ACLs and Route Policies will be outside of the digital map, they would be linked to digital map
		</li>
		<li>
			Dynamic paths may either be outside of the digital map, part of traffic engineering data/models
		</li>
		<li>
			Provide capability for conditional retrieval of parts of digital map 
		</li>
		<li>
			Must support geo-spatial, temporal, and historical data
		</li>
	 </ol>
	 <t>
		The following are the arch requirements for the Digital Map:
	 </t>
	 <ol>
		<li>
			Scale, performance, integration
		</li>
		<li>
			Initial discovery and dynamic (change only) synch

			<section anchor="how-to-augment-specific" title="How to augment for new technologies / layers">
			<t>				
			    There are already drafts that support augmentation for specific technologies.
				These drafts augment network, node, termination point and link, but also add different
				topological entities inside augmentations.
				For example, we have examples like this:
				module: new-module
				  augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:network-types:
    				+--rw new-topology!
					augment /nw:networks/nw:network:

					augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node:

					augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link:
						.... adding tunnels (te draft)

				 	augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/nt:termination-point:
						....
				There is need to agree some guidelines for augmenting IETF network topology, so that additional
				topological information is not added in the custom way. This may either involve
				- adding concepts from TE and SAP topological augmentations to the core digital map topology
				in the similar way they were added in the corresponding drafts or
				- using the TP to model SAP and 'link' to model tunnel in the core Digital Map

				   This can be a separate draft. Guidelines with examples?

		</t>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Do we need separation of L2 and L3 topologies?
			</li>
			<li>
				Do we need sublayers as well? Layers versus sublayers? E.g. Routing versus OSPF, IS-IS
			</li>
			<li>
				Same technology at service versus underlay? BGP per VPN vs common BGP shared 
				between multiple VPNs. Different layers, same model, relationship define the layer.

	  <t>
		Digital Map Modelling and Data are basis for the Digital Twin. 
		During our PoC we have proven that Digital Map can be modelled using <xref target="RFC8345"/>.
		Nevertheless, we proposed some extensions/augmentations to <xref target="RFC8345"/> to support Digital Maps.
		There must be some constraints in regards to how to augment the core Digital Map model for different 
		Layers and Technologies in order to support the approach in our PoC. All entities must augment IETF node, 
		IETF network, IETF link or IETF Termination Point and augmentation can only include new properties.
