<t>This document shares experience in modelling Digital Map based on the IETF RFC 8345 topology YANG modules and 
some of its augmentations. The document identifies a set of open issues encountered during the modelling phases, 
the missing features in RFC 8345, and some perspectives on how to address them.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t><xref target="RFC8345"/> specifies a topology YANG model with many YANG augmentations for different technologies and service types. 
The modelling approach based upon <xref target="RFC8345"/> provides a standard IETF-based API.</t>
      <t>At the time of writing (2024) and according to the YANG catalog, there are at least 92 YANG modules that are augmenting <xref target="RFC8345"/>; 
91 IETF-authored modules and 1 BBF-authored module. According to the YANG catalog, 19 of these modules have maturity level of 'ratified', 
18 of them have maturity level of 'adopted', 27 modules have maturity level of 'latest-approved', 
and 28 of these modules have maturity level of 'initial'.<br/>
The up-to-date information can be found in the YANG Catalog <xref target="Catalog"/>.</t>
      <t>From the set of IETF RFCs and I-Ds (at different level of maturity), we designed a Digital Map 
Proof of concept (PoC), with the following objectives and functionalities:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>Can the central RFC 8345 YANG module be a good basis to model a Digital Map?</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>How the different topology related IETF YANG modules fit (or not) together?</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Modelling of Digital Map entities, relationships, and rules how to build aggregated entities and relationships. Does 
the base model support key requirements that emerge for a specific layer?</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Modelling multiple underlay/overlay layers from Layer 2 to Layer 3 to customer service layer. To what extent it is 
easy to augment the base model to support new technologies?</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Can the base model be augmented for any new layer and technologies?</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>This memo documents an experience in the modeling aspects of the Digital Map, based on a PoC implementation, basically 
documenting the effort and the open issues encountered so far. During the PoC, we also identified a set of requirements 
and verified the PoC approach by demoing it iteratively.</t>
      <t>Practically, we developed a PoC with a real lab, based on multi-vendor devices, with <xref target="RFC8345"/> as the base YANG module.<br/>
The PoC successfully modelled the following:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>Layer 2 network topology (used <xref target="RFC8944"/>)</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Layer 3 network topology (used <xref target="RFC8346"/>)</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>OSPF routing topology (aligned with [I-D.ogondio-nmop-ospf-topology])</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>IS-IS routing topology (aligned with <xref target="I-D.ogondio-nmop-isis-topology"/>)</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>BGP routing topology</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>MPLS LDP</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) tunnels</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>SRv6 tunnels</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>L3VPN service</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>We are further verifying this PoC by implementing it iteratevely at the IETF Hackathons and engaging the wider community, 
starting with IETF120 Hackathon <xref target="Digital_Map_Hackathon"/>. 
The Hackathon open source is available at <xref target="Digital_Map_Hackathon_Code"/></t>
      <t>We delivered the IETF120 hackathon, with the plan to incrementally add more functionality in the future hackathons.
The multi-vendor operator LAB was used for this hackathon (with Huawei, Cisco, Juniper deviced).
The goal of the Digital Map Hackathons (starting from IETF120) is to demonstrate how operators can use 
the IETF Topology YANG models to represent a real carrier network.</t>
      <t>We started with one particular problem space: 
How to use IETF topology model to represent a real carrier network based on IS-IS and OSPF domains 
(target for planning/simulation purposes). The IETF120 Hackathon focused on generic topology queries, and started to 
compare IS-IS topology drafts augmenting RFC8345 versus potential RFC8345bis (gaps identified in RFC8345) approaches.
We also started analysis and prototype how to retrieve performance metrics or configuration attributes 
(defined in IS-IS Data Model for the IS-IS Protocol <xref target="RFC9130"/> and retrieved via device API) 
northbound from the Controller via RFC8345 API and its IS-IS augmentation.</t>

        <name>Why RFC8345 is a Good Approach for Digital Map Modelling</name>
        <t>The main reason for selecting RFC8345 for modelling is its simplicity and that is supports majority of the core requirements.</t>
        <t>Please refer to the "Digital Map: Concept, Requirements, and Use Cases" <xref target="I-D.havel-nmop-digital-map-concept"/> for 
more details of the core Digital Map requirements:</t>
        <t>The requirements REQ-BASIC-MODEL-SUPPORT, REQ-LAYERED-MODEL, REQ-PROG-OPEN-MODEL, REQ-STD-API-BASED, REQ-COMMON-APP, 
REQ-SEMANTIC, and REQ-LAYER-NAVIGATE are automatically fulfilled with RFC8345 and extensions:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>Basic model with network, node, link and interface entity types</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Layered topology</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Open and programmable</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Standard, multi-vendor</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Multi-domain</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Semantics for layered topology</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Inter-layer and between-layer relationships</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>The requirements REQ-SEMANTIC for semantics and REQ-LAYER-NAVIGATE for layered topology and relationships are partially fulfilled, there may be 
need for some additional semantics.</t>
        <t>Other core requirements REQ-EXTENSIBLE, REQ-PLUGG and REQ-GRAPH-TRAVERSAL are not supported by <xref target="RFC8345"/>:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">

          <li>
            <t>Optimized for graph traversal</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>In some cases, for REQ-PLUGG for pluggable to other YANG modules, the links are already done by augmenting 'ietf-network' 
and 'ietf-network-topology'. For others, we need to add some mechanisms to link the models and data.</t>

          <name>Bidirectional Links (RFC8345-GAP-BIDIR)</name>
          <t>One of the core characteristics of any network topology is the link
   directionality. While data flows are unidirectional, the
   bidirectional links are also common in networking.  Examples are
   Ethernet cables, bidirectional SONET rings, socket connection to the
   server, etc.  We also encounter requirements for simplified service
   layer topology, where we want to model link as bidirectional to be
   supported by unidirectional links at the lower layer.</t>
          <t><xref target="RFC8345"/> defines all links as unidirectional, it does not support
   bidirectional links. It was done intentionally to keep the model as
   simple as possible. While simplifying the model itself, the data
   and APIs are more complex for the cases with bidirectional
   links. In such cases, there is no need to increase the amount of instances / data
   transferred via API, stored in the database, or managed/monitored by modeling
   unidirectional links.</t>
          <t>This document suggests to model the bidirectional
   connections as pairs of unidirectional links.</t>
          <t><xref target="I-D.davis-opsawg-some-refinements-to-rfc8345"/> further elaborates on the need for bidirectional links in the 
   network topologies and in the Digital Map.  It also proposes how RFC8345 can be augmented to support missing components.</t>
          <t>The following are the candidate approaches of how we can address this limitation:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>Use the current RFC8345 approach and implement it via multiple unidirectional links</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Don't change RFC8345, leave to different augmentations to solve the problem their own way</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Augment RFC8345 via basic approach as suggested in <xref target="I-D.davis-opsawg-some-refinements-to-rfc8345"/>, fully backward compatible, appears simple and sufficient</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Augment RFC8345 via more sophisticated approach as suggested in <xref target="I-D.davis-opsawg-some-refinements-to-rfc8345"/>, more complex but improves the integrity of the model, same instance structures produced</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Consider RFC8345bis</t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>We suggest to start the work on RFC8345bis to provide the backward compatible way to support bidirectional 
links in the core topology model defined in ietf-network-topology. The starting point can be the basic approach from
<xref target="I-D.davis-opsawg-some-refinements-to-rfc8345"/> that adds the following:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>direction-of-link with value BIDIRECTIONAL</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>direction-of-point with value BIDIRECTIONAL</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>list of termination points that could be used for bidirectional links as an alternative to having source and 
destination for unidirectional (although we can also implement it via the existing source and destination when 
direction BIDIRECTIONAL)</t>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section anchor="multipoint-connectivity-rfc8345-gap-multi-point">
          <name>Multipoint Connectivity (RFC8345-GAP-MULTI-POINT)</name>
          <t>The RFC8345 defines all links as point to point and unidirectional, it does not support multi-point links 
   (hub and spoke, full mesh, complex).  It was done intentionally to keep the model as simple as possible. 
   The RFC suggests to model the multi-point networks via pseudo nodes.</t>
          <t>Same as with unidirectionality, while simplifying the model itself, we are making data and APIs more complex for 
   multi point topologies and we are increasing the amount of data transferred via API, stored in the database or 
   managed/monitored.</t>
          <t>One of the core characteristics of any network topology is its type and link cardinality.  Any topology model 
   should be able to model any topology type in a simple and explicit way, including point to multipoint, bus, ring, 
   star, tree, mesh, hybrid and daisy chain.  Any topology model should also be able to model any link cardinality in 
   a simple and explicit way, including point to point, point to multipoint, multipoint to multipoint or hybrid.</t>
          <t>By forcing the implementation of all topology types and all options for cardinality via unidirectional links and 
   pseudo nodes, we are significantly increasing the complexity of APIs and data, but also lacking full topology

          <t>The RFC8345 defines all links as belonging to one network instance and having the source and destination as node and 
termination point only, not allowing to link to termination point of another network. This does not allow for links 
between networks in the case of multi-domains or partitioning. The only way would be to model each domain as 
node and have links between them.</t>
          <t>In our IS-IS PoC and Hackathon (following <xref target="I-D.ogondio-nmop-isis-topology"/>), we modelled IS-IS areas as networks 
and we needed to extend the capability to have links between different areas.  We added network reference as well to 
the source / destination of the link.  <xref target="RFC8795"/> also augments links with external-domain info for the case of 
links that connect different domains.</t>
          <t>The IS-IS topology <xref target="I-D.ogondio-nmop-isis-topology"/> models Autonomous System (AS) or IS-IS domain as a network, 
and IS-IS areas as attributes of IS-IS nodes.  The RFC8345 extension can be used to model IS-IS areas as networks and 
IS-IS links between L1-2 nodes as links between two different areas.  This is not problem for OSPF, although the OSPF 
nodes can belong to multiple areas, the links can belong to only one area.</t>
          <t>The following are some benefits of lifting the RFC 8345 limitations that all links must belong to only one network

        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>Do we need separation of L2 and L3 topologies?  </t>
            <t>
During the PoC/Hackathon we encountered different solutions with separate
set of requirements.  In one solution, the L2 and L3 topology were
the same with separate set of attributes, while in another
solution we had difference in L2 and L3 topology (e.g.  Links
Aggregation, Switches and Routers).  </t>
            <t>
The RFC8944 defines L2 topology and RFC8346 defines the L3
topology.  They allow to have either one or two instances of this
topology.  </t>
            <t>
The decision if we need separate network instances for L2 and L3
topologies may be based on specific network topology and
provider's preferences.  </t>
            <t>
Resolved: the RFC8345 is flexible and it can support both the same network instance with L2 + L3 augmentations 
or separate network instances with supporting relationship between. The operator should decide what option is 
needed for their solution.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Do we need sublayers as well?  Layers versus sublayers versus
layered instances?  </t>
            <t>
Resolved: Layers/sublayers could be implemented via multiple network types. The new data nodes for layer are present only when the network type for the layer is present. The new data nodes for the sublayer are present when the network types for both layer and sublayer are present. The solution could also enable either single or multiple instances, like in the previous point.  </t>
            <t>
Further analysis: In the case that the same technology is used at different layers, we may need some additional information in the model, in the case that it cannot be modelled via network types + supporting relations.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Same technology at service versus underlay?  BGP per VPN vs common
BGP shared between multiple VPNs.  Different layers, same model,
relationship define the layer.  </t>

          <li>
            <t>There are potential circular dependencies in layering. For example routing can be underlay for tunnels, but tunnel interface can also be in the routing table.  </t>

        <name>Why Analysis?</name>
        <t>During our PoC and Hackathon, we decided to use the RFC8345  model and API for the layered topology from the physical to the top layer, accross the domains, without the need to understand any specific information about specific domain, technologies and details required for specific network management functions / use cases.</t>
        <t>We took the hat of application developer and used the software architecture guidelines to provide the right level of abstraction for topologies at the controller northbound interfaces. This means that the API client /application must understand and draw the topology from RFC8345 (as originally intended by this draft) without understanding all augmentations that add new topological entities / relations.</t>
        <t>After determining that the RFC8345 can provide the right level of abstraction for the layered topology (and be improved by addressing gaps via backward compatible way), we wanted to understand if different IETF RFC8345 augmentations add its own topology semantics and if they address any gaps we identified.</t>

        <name>What did we Analyse?</name>
        <t>Our goal was to do some high level analysis of all the modules that augment the RFC8345 and understand the following 2 high level points:</t>

3. Make backward compatible updates to RFC8345, work on RFC8345 bis
]]></artwork>
        <t>The following are some important guidelines mentioned in the RFC8345 that should be taken into account when suggesting 
the approach:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>"The data models allow applications to operate on an inventory or topology of any network at a generic level, 
where the specifics of particular inventory/topology types are not required.
At the same time, where data specific to a network type comes into play and the data model is augmented, 
the instantiated data still adheres to the same structure and is represented in a consistent fashion.<br/>
This also facilitates the representation of network hierarchies and dependencies between different network components 
and network types"</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>“It is possible for links at one level of a hierarchy to map to multiple links at another level of the hierarchy.<br/>
For example, a VPN topology might model VPN tunnels as links.  Where a VPN tunnel maps to a path that is composed of 
a chain of several links, the link will contain a list of those supporting links.  Likewise, it is possible for a 
link at one level of a hierarchy to aggregate a bundle of links at another level of the hierarchy."</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>Our recommendation on how to extend RFC8345 for Digital Map is to stay in spirit of RFC8345 and augment with 
non-topological info only. Reuse network, node, link, tp for all topological entities, reuse supporting for 
layering and add new properties/attributes and references to other modules
Therefore, we suggest to work on RFC8345 bis to provide the backward compatible way to address all 
identified limitations.</t>
        <t>The alternative of having the core topology augmentations in either TE modules or technology specific modules is not generic enough and is not in the spirit of having the core topology model to model topology in the consistent manner between different technologies and TE and non-TE topologies.</t>

        <t>There are already drafts that support augmentation for specific
   technologies.  These drafts augment network, node, termination point
   and link, but also add different topological entities inside
   augmentations.  For example, we have examples like this:</t>

        <t>There is a need to agree some guidelines for augmenting IETF network
   topology, so that additional topological information is not added in
   the custom way.  There is also need to categorize the current augmentations and the impact of RFC 8345 bis

      <name>Conclusions</name>
      <t>Digital Map Modelling and Data are needed for the current Operator Use Cases, and are also basis for the Digital Twin. 
During our PoC and Hackathon we have proven that Digital Map can be modelled using <xref target="RFC8345"/>.<br/>
Nevertheless, we proposed some extensions/augmentations to <xref target="RFC8345"/> to support Digital Maps.</t>
      <t>After analysing all augmentations of RFC8345 modules, we determined that there must exist some constraints in 
regards to how to augment the core Digital Map model for different Layers and Technologies in order to support the 
approach recommended in RFC8345 and implemented in our PoC/Hackathon. Therefore, we recommend that IETF adopts the 
guidelines how to augment the core RFC8345 modules for Digital Map. 
All entities should augment IETF node, IETF network, IETF link or IETF Termination Point and augmentation can 
only include new properties, events, non-topological references.</t>
      <t>We suggest to start the work on RFC8345 bis to provide the backward compatible way to support the following basic 
topological features:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>bidirectional links</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>multipoint connectivity</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>cross-domain links via links between networks</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>multi-domain via network partitioning</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>shared topological entities between different domains</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>additional supporting relations</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>additional semantics required for core topologies</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>We also suggest to start working on a new draft that would define the RFC8345 augmentation or new modules for the purpose of
* connecting IETF topology module to other IETF YANG modules (what yang paths are connected to node, termination-point)
* defining what IETF topology module instances are related to the IETF YANG module instances (because we have different keys)
* avoid duplication the properties in RFC8345 augmentations</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>   This draft provides a brief analysis of the current unidirectional
   point-to-point approach to modeling of the link in RFC8345,
   highlights why this is not sufficient and makes a proposal to enhance
   RFC8345 YANG to support multipoint uni/bi links.  The two alternative
   enhancement approaches proposed are backward compatible.  The
   enhancement is such that it provides a uniform solution to modeling
   all links that could, over time, replace the current unidirectional
   point-to-point approach.  The rationale for the change is based on
   many years of practical experience, including challenges using
   RFC8345 in actual solution development, and insight gained through
   other standardisation efforts and deployments.
