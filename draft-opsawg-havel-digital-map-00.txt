1.  Introduction

   The [RFC8345] is a topology based YANG model with many extensions for
   different technologies and service types.  The modelling approach
   based on [RFC8345] provides the out of box standard IETF based API.

   At the time of writing those lines, there are 60 YANG Modules
   augmenting [RFC8345], 59 IETF and 1 BBF. 8 have maturity level
   'ratified', 15 have maturity level 'adopted', 21 have maturity level
   'latest-approved' and 16 have maturity level 'initial'.  The up to
   date information can be found in the YANG Catalogue at
   https://yangcatalog.org/yang-search/impact_analysis/ietf-network-
   topology@2018-02-26.

   From this long series of IETF RFCs and IETF drafts, we attempted to
   create a Digital Map PoC, with the following objectives and
   functionality:

   *  Modelling of digital map entities, relationships, and rules how to
      build aggregated entities and relationships.  Basically evaluating
      how well the different drafts fit together

   *  Modelling multiple underlay/overlay layers from L2 to customer
      service layer

   *  We based our modelling on [RFC8345] and we successfully modelled
      the following using this approach:

   - L2 Network Topology (used [RFC8944])

   - L3 Network Topology (used [RFC8346])

   - OSPF Routing (to be further aligned with
   [I-D.ogondio-opsawg-ospf-topology])

   - IS-IS Routing (to be further aligned with
   [I-D.ogondio-lsr-isis-topology])

   - BGP Routing

   - MPLS LDP

   - MPLS TE Tunnels

   - SRv6 Tunnels

   - L3 VPN Services

   This draft documents our experience implementing the modelling a real
   network with the topology YANG modules [RFC8345] model and its
   extensions.

   While we progress our Digital Map PoC, we want to share our
   experience and some open issues encountered.

Internet-Draft            Digital Map Modelling               March 2023


   During the PoC, we also defined the requirements and verified the PoC
   approach by demoing it iteratively.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Digital Map Modelling -  Modelling the Digital Map using the IETF
      [RFC8345] approach, by defining the supported network types
      (layers and sublayers), entity types, entity roles (network, node,
      tp or link), entity properties and relationships types between
      entities.

   Digital Map -  A basis for the Digital Twin that provides a virtual
      instance of the topological information of the network.  It
      provides the core multi-layer topology model of the digital twin
      that defines the core topological entities, their role in the
      network, core properties and relationships both inside each layer
      and between the layers.  It is the basic topological model that is
      extended with other functional parts of the digital twin and
      connects them all: configuration, maintenance, assurance (KPIs,
      status, health, symptoms), traffic engineering, different
      behaviours, simulation, emulation, mathematical abstractions, AI
      algorithms, etc

   Digital Twin -  as defined in
      [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch], it as 'a virtual
      instance of a physical system (twin) that is continually updated
      with the latter's performance, maintenance and health status data
      throughout the physical system's life cycle'.

2.  Digital Map Intro and how it relates to Digital Twin

2.1.  What is Digital Twin?

   The digital twin concepts and the reference architecture of the
   network digital twin are proposed in the NMRG draft
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch].  This draft defines the
   Digital Twin as 'a virtual instance of a physical system (twin) that
   is continually updated with the latter’s performance, maintenance and
   health status data throughout the physical system’s life cycle'.






Havel, et al.           Expires 29 September 2023               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            Digital Map Modelling               March 2023


   The draft [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] also states that
   a digital twin network can be regarded as an indispensable part of
   the overall network system and provides a general architecture
   involving the whole life cycle of physical networks in the future,
   serving the application of innovative network technologies such as
   network planning, construction, maintenance and optimization,
   improving the automation and intelligence level of the network.

   The draft [I-D.irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch] defines the core
   elements of digital twin – Data, Models, Interfaces and Mapping.  The
   digital twin network constructed based on the four core technology
   elements can analyze, diagnose, emulate, and control the physical
   network in its whole life cycle with the help of optimization
   algorithms, management methods, and expert knowledge

2.2.  Digital Map Definition

   Digital Map provides the core multi-layer topology model and data for
   the digital twin and connects them to the other digital twin models
   and data.

   The Digital Map Model defines the core topological entities, their
   role in the network, core properties and relationships both inside
   each layer and between the layers.

   The Digital Map Model is a basic topological model that is extended
   with other functional parts of the digital twin and connects them
   all: configuration, maintenance, assurance (KPIs, status, health,
   symptoms), traffic engineering, different behaviours and actions,
   simulation, emulation, mathematical abstractions, AI algorithms, etc.

   The Digital Map Data consists of virtual instances of network and
   service topologies at different layers.  The Digital Map provides the
   access to this data via standard API for both read and write, with
   query capabilities and links to other YANG modules (SAIN, SAP,
   Inventory, Assets, …) and non-YANG mode.

2.3.  Why Digital Map?

   One of the important requirements for the Digitalization and Digital
   Twin is to correlate all models and data to topological entities at
   different layers in the layered twin network.  This draft proposes A
   Digital Map Model as a basis for the Digitalization and Digital Twin.
   The Digital Map would provide a virtual instance of the topological
   information of the network, based on this Digital Map Model.  The
   Digital Map is the first step towards the Digital Twin.  The Digital
   Map Model and Data will provide this missing correlation between the
   topology models and data and all other models and data: KPIs, alarms,

Internet-Draft            Digital Map Modelling               March 2023


   incidents, inventory (with UUIDs), configuration, traffic
   engineering, planning (what if), simulation, emulations, actions,
   behaviours.  Some of these models and data are in the context of
   device, some in context of network or subnetwork and some in context
   of customer services, needed for both inner and outer closed-loops.
   Therefore, Digital Map is needed to break down data islands and have
   a digital twin for simulation and closed loop, which is required to
   solve autonomous networking.  The following are some use cases that
   require Digital Map:

   *  Generic Inventory Queries

   *  o Service-> subservice -> resource

   *  o Resource -> subservice -> service

   *  Intent/Service Assurance

   *  Service E2E and Per-Link KPIs on the digital map (delay, jitter,
      loss)

   *  Capacity Planning

   *  Simulation

   *  Closed Loop

2.4.  Other Related IETF Activities

   The following standards are core for the Digital Map.

   *  IETF Network Model and Network Topology Model [RFC8345]

   *  A YANG Grouping for Geographic Location [RFC9179]

   *  IETF Modules that augment [RFC8345] for differenet technologies:

   *  o A YANG Data Model for Traffic Engineering (TE) Topologies
      [RFC8795]

   *  o A YANG Data Model for Layer 2 Network Topologies [RFC8944]

   *  o A YANG Data Model for OSFP Topology
      [I-D.ogondio-opsawg-ospf-topology]

   *  o A YANG Data Model for IS-IS Topology
      [I-D.ogondio-lsr-isis-topology]

Internet-Draft            Digital Map Modelling               March 2023


   The Digital Map may need to link to the following models, some are
   already augmenting [RFC8345], we need further investigation for each
   of these items:

   *  Service Access Point (SAP) [I-D.ietf-opsawg-sap], augments 'ietf-
      network' data model [RFC8345] by adding the SAP inventory

   *  SAIN [I-D.ietf-opsawg-service-assurance-architecture] and
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-service-assurance-yang]

   *  An Inventory Management Model for Enterprise Networks
      [I-D.wzwb-opsawg-network-inventory-management] augments 'ietf-
      network-topology' with inventory information for node, link and
      termination-point.  It also has UUIDs.

   *  Data Model for Lifecycle Management and Operations
      [I-D.palmero-opsawg-dmlmo]

   *  KPIs: delay, jitter, loss

   *  Attachement Circuits (ACs)
      [I-D.boro-opsawg-ntw-attachment-circuit] and
      [I-D.boro-opsawg-teas-attachment-circuit]

   *  Configuration: L2SM [RFC8466], L3SM [RFC8049], L2NM [RFC9291],
      L3NM [RFC9182]

   *  Incident Management for Network Services
      [I-D.feng-opsawg-incident-management]

   *  Transaction ID

   *  Etc?

3.  Digital Map Requirements

   The following are the core requirements for the Digital Map:

   1.   Basic model with Network, Node, Link, Interface

   2.   Layered Digital Map, from physical network up to customer
        service and intent









Havel, et al.           Expires 29 September 2023               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            Digital Map Modelling               March 2023


   3.   Open and Programmable Digital Map. This includes read / Write
        for Digital Map (write important for future simulations and what
        if scenarios).  Doing what-if analysis requires the ability to
        take snapshots and to switch easily between them.  Because we
        have to distinguish between a change on the digital map for
        future simulation and a change that reflects the current reality
        of the network.

   4.   Standard based Digital Map Models and APIs (e.g. based on IETF
        Network Topology).  Digital Map must provide the standards APIs
        that provide for Read / Write and queries.  This API must also
        provide the capability to retrieve the links to external data /
        models.

   5.   Digital Map Models and APIs must be common over different
        network domains

   6.   Digital Map must be multi-vendor

   7.   Digital Map must provide semantics for layered network
        topologies and for linking external models/data

   8.   Digital Map must provide inter-layer and between layer
        relationships

   9.   Digital Map must be extensible with meta data

   10.  Digital Map must be pluggable a) We must connect to other YANG
        modules for Configuration, Inventory, Intent Assurance (SAIN),
        etc b) Not everything can be in YANG, we need to connect Digital
        Map YANG model with other modelling mechanisms, both southbound,
        northbound and internally

   11.  Digital Map must be optimized for graph traversal for paths.
        This means that only providing link nodes and source and sink
        relationships to termination-points may not be sufficient, we
        may need to have the direct relationship between the termination
        points or nodes

   The requirements [1-6] are automatically fulfilled with RFC8345 and
   extensions.  The requirements [7-8] are partially fulfiled, there may
   be need for some additional semantics.  The requirements [9-11] will
   need some extensions to the RFC8345.  In some cases for [10], the
   links are already sone by augmenting 'ietf-network' and 'ietf-
   network-topology'.  For others, we need to add some mechanims to link
   the models and data.

   The following are the scope requirements for the Digital Map:

Internet-Draft            Digital Map Modelling               March 2023


   1.  Digital Map should contain only topological information

   2.  Digital Map entities should contain only properties used to
       identify topological entities at different layers, identify their
       roles and topological relationships between them

   3.  Digital Map should contain only topological relationships inside
       each layer or between the layers (underlay/overlay)

   4.  Digital Map should only have links to other functional Digital
       Twin data and models.

   5.  ACLs and Route Policies will be outside of the digital map, they
       would be linked to digital map

   6.  Dynamic paths may either be outside of the digital map, part of
       traffic engineering data/models

   7.  Provide capability for conditional retrieval of parts of digital
       map

   8.  Must support geo-spatial, temporal, and historical data

   The following are the arch requirements for the Digital Map:

   1.  Scale, performance, integration

   2.  Initial discovery and dynamic (change only) synch

Internet-Draft            Digital Map Modelling               March 2023


4.1.2.  What is not in the basic model

   The following are the [RFC8345] extensions needed for Digital Map
   modelling and APIs:

   *  Bidirectional links

   *  Multi-point connectivity (hub and spoke, full mesh, complex)

   *  We may need additional supporting relationships: supporting for
      TP->Node, supporting for Node->Network

   *  More Network-related semantic is needed, for example:

   *  We modelled Tunnels ad Paths via [RFC8345] but we lost some
      semantics that is in RFC8795

   *  We modelled all relationships via supporting, maybe extend with
      how underlay is done in RFC8795

   *  Relationship Properties

   *  Subtypes

   *  Layers/ sub-layers

   *  Some common roles: primary, backup, aggregation, hub, spoke

4.1.3.  Open issues for further analysis

   The following are the open issues that need further analysis:

   *  Do we need separation of L2 and L3 topologies?

   *  Do we need sublayers as well?  Layers versus sublayers?  E.g.
      Routing versus OSPF, IS-IS

   *  Same technology at service versus underlay?  BGP per VPN vs common
      BGP shared between multiple VPNs.  Different layers, same model,
      relationship define the layer.

4.1.4.  How to connect to the external world

   How to connect to other YANG modules

   How to connect YANG models with other modelling mechanisms

4.1.5.  Digital Map APIs

   This will include hierarchical APIs for cross-domain figure, IETF
   YANG Based API (read and write, change subscription and notify) and
   Query API

4.1.6.  Digital Map Knowledge

   The following knowledge was needed to build digital map:

   *  Abstract IETF Entities and Relationships as in [RFC8345]

   *  [RFC8345] Augmentations for a)Layers/sublayers b)Entities
      (services and subservices), c)Properties

   *  Rules for aggregating entities

   *  Rules for instantiating relationships Relationships (inter-layer
      and intra-layer)

   *  Mapping from devices and controllers

   What can be achieved with existing RFC8345 YANG:

   *  Entities (base class IETF Network, IETF Node, IETF Link, IETF TP)

   *  Properties

   *  Relationships

   Next steps

   *  How to add temporal

   *  How to add spacial

   *  How to add historical

5.  Conclusions

   Digital Map Modelling and Data are basis for the Digital Twin.
   During our PoC we have proven that Digital Map can be modelled using
   [RFC8345].  Nevertheless, we proposed some extensions/augmentations
   to [RFC8345] to support Digital Maps.  There must be some constraints
   in regards to how to augment the core Digital Map model for different
   Layers and Technologies in order to support the approach in our PoC.
   All entities must augment IETF node, IETF network, IETF link or IETF
   Termination Point and augmentation can only include new properties.
